                <p class="bio">Dimitrije is a fourth-year Microbiology student at UofT. His research interests include the physiology of DNA viruses as well as viral latency. He has experience in a wide variety of research settings, having worked on developing novel hydrogels for affordable 3D cell culture media; studying the early latency mechanisms of Epstein-Barr Virus through modulation of c-Jun kinase; modeling isPETase and its interaction with a substrate PET tetramer model, for the purposes of improving enzymatic activity; and also having done clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital, developing new assays and evaluating the effect of changes in equipment and procedure patient outcomes. In his spare time, he is an amateur historian and medievalist, a lover of traditional dance and music, an enthusiastic whistler, and a fan of grand strategy games and Dwarf Fortress.
